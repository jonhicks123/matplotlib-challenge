## Observations and Insights

- It is observable that the size of the mouse has a strong correlation to the average tumor size, as the scatter plots show that heavier
  mice had larger average tumor volumes compared to mice with lower weights. As for the 45 day duration of testing, there were no mice 
  out of the sample selection that got rid of the tumor entirely. If the testing duration were to be extended, it would be insightful to
  see if any of the drug regimens were able to eradicate the tumors from any of the mice.
  
- As for the drug regimens which were focused largely towards the end of the analysis, Capomulin and Ramicane prove to be much more effective 
  as opposed to Infubinol and Ceftamine, and are rather similar in comparision. The only drug regimen in this particular section of the 
  analysis that had outliers was Infubinol, though it only contained one outlier. It can be concluded that Ramicane is another great drug 
  regimen that Pymaceuticals should use alongside Capomulin. Something that should be researched further would be the other drug regimens, 
  and whether or not any of them are as successful in reducing tumor size as Capomulin and Ramicane.
  
- The sample size was split almost evenly between female and male mice, with male mice at 51% of the sample size and females at 49%. 
  Something that would be interesting to analyze would be the reduction rate of males compared to females to see whether males and females
  had relatively similar tumor-size reduction rates or if one gender specifically had better succes than the other.
