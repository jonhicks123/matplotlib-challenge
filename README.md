# Pymaceuticals

#### Background of the Study

Acting as a senior data analyst at a pharmaceutical company, I analyzed the data of a study containing 249 mice which were identified with SCC tumor growth. The mice were treated  through a variety of drug regimens over the course of 45 days, and their tumor developments were observed and measured to identify the rate of tumor reductions as well as the effectiveness of the drug regimen. Pymaceuticals' drug of interest is Capomulin, so the main purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of other treatment regimens to see if any other treatments should be further researched and developed. 

## Observations and Insights

- It is observable that the size of the mouse has a strong correlation to the average tumor size, as the scatter plots show that heavier mice had larger average tumor volumes compared to mice with lower weights. As for the 45 day duration of testing, there were no mice out of the sample selection that got rid of the tumor entirely. If the testing duration were to be extended, it would be insightful to see if any of the drug regimens were able to eradicate the tumors from any of the mice.
  
- As for the drug regimens which were focused largely towards the end of the analysis, Capomulin and Ramicane prove to be much more effective as opposed to Infubinol and Ceftamine, and are rather similar in comparision. The only drug regimen in this particular section of the analysis that had outliers was Infubinol, though it only contained one outlier. It can be concluded that Ramicane is another great drug regimen that Pymaceuticals should use alongside Capomulin. Something that should be researched further would be the other drug regimens, and whether or not any of them are as successful in reducing tumor size as Capomulin and Ramicane.
  
- The sample size was split almost evenly between female and male mice, with male mice at 51% of the sample size and females at 49%. Something that would be interesting to analyze would be the reduction rate of males compared to females to see whether males and females had relatively similar tumor-size reduction rates or if one gender specifically had better succes than the other.
